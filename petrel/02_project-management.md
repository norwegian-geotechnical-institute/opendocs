# Projects

## New project

New projects can be created by proceeding to {kbd}`File` and then click {kbd}`New Project`.

```

If not previously set, you will be prompted for a coordinate reference system (CRS).
Example CRSs are EPSG:32633 (WGS84 UTM33N) or EPSG:23033 (ED50 UTM33).
Find either in the popup, then press {kbd}`OK` once you are done to initialise the project.
